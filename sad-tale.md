House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
begin, and let me assure you he will ___DEFINITELY NOT DIE!___

Unfortunately, Ned was not able to notice the knife already lodged in his back. y the time that he did, it was too late. Blamed for something he did not do, his life was and his head were taken from him. Ned's eldest daughter, Sansa, had the misfortune of being a firsthand witness, in the splash section. It would take more than that to rattle her mind enough and pull her head from out of the clouds, yet in time, she does see the snakes for what they are. 

Ned watched from on high as his eldest son and wife were murdered and the rest of his children endured trials that one must only speak of in hushed tones and dimmed light for fear of invoking the curses that consomed the Stark family on their own familes. The crucible moment for the Starks seems to last a lifetime, but it is hard to say with confidence that anyone else would have been able to bear the tasks that were thrust upon them.
